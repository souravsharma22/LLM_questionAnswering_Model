The Congress appealed to the people to use Swadeshi goods and\nfollow peaceful and legitimate means to achieve the end. The Non-cooperation\nMovement initially appeared to have gathered great momentum. Gandhi travelled", "the whole country in order to get support from the people. He returned the medal\nwhich was awarded to him for his services to the British Government during the\nFirst World War. People belonging to different states stopped cooperating with", "the British government. Many lawyers left the courts and students voluntarily joined\nthe movement, leaving their schools and colleges. The boycott of elections to the\nlegislature was also quite successful. The Congress also boycotted the visit of the", "Prince of Wales who visited India in 1921. A strike was observed at places where\nthe Prince of Wales was visiting.

The sense of unity brought about by the\nmovement was quite unusual in the history of the country and it paved the way for", "achieving independence in the future.\nCivil Disobedience Movement\nAnother important movement in India\u2019s freedom struggle was the Civil\nDisobedience Movement. Its aim was to disobey the laws of the British\ngovernment. Like the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Civil Disobedience", "Movement was based on Gandhi\u2019s principle of non-violence. As a token of\ndisobedience of the unjust laws of the British, Gandhi chose to violate the Salt\nLaw, which was a law that prohibited the people from manufacturing salt. Gandhi", "started his famous Salt March on March 12, 1930, along with 70 other satyagrahis;\nby the time he reached the sea coast near the village of Dandi, thousands had\njoined him. Gandhi\u2019s violation of the Salt Law sparked large scale acts of civil", "disobedience against the British Raj salt laws by millions of Indians.

It is also known as the August Revolution. The\nbackground of the movement was the failure of the Cripps mission and a lack of\nsympathetic attitude of the British colonial government towards Indian\nindependence. During the Bombay Session of the Congress held on 7th and 8th", "August 1942, Gandhi gave a call to the people of India to \u2018Do or Die\u2019. The\npurpose of the movement was to force the British government to quit India lock,\nstock and barrel. The Quit India Movement had great impact on the people.", "Students left their studies, lawyers gave up their practice, government officials\nresigned in order to join the movement. Gandhi and other leaders of the Congress\nwere arrested by the British, however, this made no impact on the movement.", "At first the movement was peaceful but later it took a violent turn. Cases of\nviolence were reported from many places. Railway stations, post offices, etc.\nwere set ablaze. Railway bridges and buildings were destroyed. Treasuries were", "looted and government records were destroyed. The British government started a\npolicy of repression to suppress the movement. But it was not that easy as the\npeople were spontaneously fired by the enthusiasm of driving out the British", "government. However, before the superior strength of the British government, the\nrevolutionaries could not carry on their struggle for long. Ultimately, they were\nsuppressed and the movement was quelled. The Quit India Movement had great", "significance. The entire cross section of Indian society, irrespective of caste, class,\nregion or religion joined the movement to drive the British. Thereby, the struggle\nfor independence that was almost one hundred years old approached the total", "mass, i.e., encompassing the entire cross-section of the society, making Indian\nindependence inevitable.\nIndian independence was achieved not through a single revolution, but\nthrough a prolonged, popular struggle based on a moral, political and ideological", "commitment. This struggle started from socio-religious resistance movements in\nthe nineteenth century, which was then passed on to the English educated intellectuals.\nThe struggle trickled down to the students and the middle classes during the days", "of the Swadeshi Movement.

What is the Quit India Movement also known as?\n1.3 THE MAKING OF INDIAN CONSTITUTION\nAND ITS SOURCES\nThe Indian political system in general and its Constitution in particular were not\ncreated just after the transfer of power from the British. The structure and values", "of independent India\u2019s political system is largely the products of the evolution of\nthe ideological legacy and conceptual discourse during the national movement.\nThe Indian national movement, which was based on new political ideas, a", "new intellectual perception of reality, new social, economic and political objectives\nand above all new techniques of political organisation, ultimately led to the emergence\nof India as an independent nation and a unique political system.", "The impact of the national movement in the minds of the people of India\nwas very deep and it made them aware of the concept of politics in the domain of\nthe people. The Indian National Congress took up the task of politicizing, activism", "and mobilizing the Indian masses and thereby made them aware of their rights and\nduties. The Congress was able to mobilize all classes, castes, religion and regions\nof the Indian society. Thus, it can be said that political democracy is the cardinal", "principle of which the sovereignty of the people is a legacy of the national movement.\nFrom the beginning, the nationalist leaders believed that India could eventually\nmove towards democratic self-government. In the early phase, moderate leaders", "demanded self-government with a step by step approach by demanding the\nexpansion of powers of the Legislative councils and their enlargement for the\nrepresentatives elected directly by people. Eventually, with the gradual widening", "of its social base, the national movement during Gandhian phase demanded for\n\u2018Purna Swaraj\u2019, meaning thereby, complete independence. It is worth mentioning\nthat although the definition of nationalist political goal was at variance in the", "moderates, extremist and Gandhian phase of the national movement, the goal of\ndemocratic self-government was implicit from the beginning. The objective of the\npolitical democracy is also reflected in the stress on civil liberties like the freedom", "of speech, the freedom of press, freedom of thought and association whose\nmaintenance and extension became an integral part of national movement.\nMoreover, the very organisation and functioning of the Indian National Congress,", "the chief representative and the symbol of the national movement, by its insistence\non debate and discussion reflected and popularized democratic tradition. Thus\nover the years, the national movement successfully created the ideology and culture", "of democracy and civil liberties based on respect for decent, freedom of expression,\nthe majority principle, and the right of the minority opinions.\nSelf - Learning\nMaterial 9\nThe Indian Constitution The nationalist leaders\u2019 ideas and views on economics had a significant", "impact on the formulation of economic principles of the country. They developed\nan anti-colonial ideology and developed a drain theory. They could realize that the\nchanges in Indian economy had a transition from traditional feudal backwardness\nNOTES", "NOTES\nto colonial backwardness leading to backward agriculture, repressed industry\nand foreign domination of economic life. Apart from providing a strong critique of\ncolonial economic policies, they also provided alternate solutions and remedial", "measures to the pressing problems of poverty and deprivation. From the beginning,\nthe nationalist movement had an objective of complete transformation of the country\non the basis of modern industrial and agricultural development. However, Gandhi", "was an exception who stressed more on agrarian transformation and cottage\nindustries. The national leadership right from Dadabhai Naoroji and Mahadev\nGovind Ranade visualized a crucial role for the state in the building of an independent", "and modern economy. The idea of planning an economic development was also\npopularized during the nationalist movement. On the whole, the national leaders\nwere optimistic that a development strategy, based on an independent strategy", "and self-reliant industrialisation actively added by the state, would transform the\nIndian economic scene.\nThe nationalist leaders were also influenced by the great economic depression\nof the 1930s, the socialist planning in the Soviet Union and anti-Fascist wave over", "the world in 1930s. Most of the leaders of the Youth Movement of 1920s and a\nlarge number of revolutionary freedom fighters were also attracted by socialism.\nAs a result, socialist ideals soon became the basic constituent of nationalist thoughts", "and the Congress progressively evolved in a radical socio-economic and political\ndirection, which had a significant impact on the making of our political system. The\noverall social outlook of Gandhi, which constituted a major ideological dimension", "of the national movement, was that of social transformation. His emphasis on\nsocial and economic equality; self-activity of masses; the removal of distinction\nand discrimination between physical and mental labour; women\u2019s social liberation;", "upliftment and welfare of the exploited, the oppressed and the downtrodden; and\nthe principles of bread labour and trusteeship impacted a radical and ideological\ndirection to the national movement.\nOne major objectives that the Indian national movement set for itself was to", "promote the unification process, to weld Indians into a nation, to unify Indian\npeople and thus to promote the national unity. Secularism was another major\nideological dimension of the national movement through which it sought to bind", "the multi-religious and multi-ethnic society into a nation. This aspect of the national\nmovement, which is reflected in independent India, is its external policy. Indian\nleaders had developed a broad international outlook. Over the years, they evolved", "a policy of opposition to imperialism on a worldwide scale and solidarity with\nanti-colonial movement in other parts of the world. We may, therefore, say that a\nnon-racist, anti-imperialist outlook, which continued to characterize the Indian", "foreign policy for a long time was a part of the legacy of the national movement.\nThe effort of the national leaders resulted in the formation of a grand nationalist\nalliance in which Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs; the rich and the poor, landlords,\nSelf - Learning\n10 Material", "Self - Learning\n10 Material\nindustrialists and the middle classes; peasants, artisans and tribes; all joined their The Indian Constitution\nhands together.

Kashyap, \u2018the text of the Preamble stands for the fundamental", "Constitutional values in which the founding fathers believed, which they wanted to\nfoster among the people of the Republic and which, they hoped, would guide all\nthose who, from generation to generation, were called upon to work.\u2019 The values", "expressed in the Preamble are sovereignty, socialism, secularism, democracy,\nrepublican character, justice, liberty, equality, fraternity, human dignity and the unity\nand integrity of the Nation. In addition to them, our Constitution promotes respect", "for diversity and minority rights, accommodates regional and political assertions\nthrough federalism and fosters international peace and cooperation.\nThe Preamble to the Constitution of India reads as follows:\nWe, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute", "India into a SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:\nJUSTICE, social, economic and political;\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\nEQUALITY of status and opportunity; and to promote them all;", "FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and\nintegrity of the nation;\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of\nNOVEMBER, 1949 do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO\nOURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.\nThe wordings of the Preamble make it clear that the basic tasks which the", "Constitution makers envisaged for the Indian state were to achieve the goals of\njustice, liberty, equality and fraternity. These objectives help us to decode the\nmessages and mandates of our Constitution in terms of our contemporary needs\nand futuristic perspectives.", "and futuristic perspectives.\nThe Preamble also discusses the nature of the Indian political system. The Indian\npolity is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.\n(i) Sovereignty\nBy declaring us as a sovereign entity, the Preamble emphasizes complete political\nfreedom.", "freedom.\nIt implies that our state is internally powerful and externally free. She is free\nto determine for herself without any external interference. There is none within her\nto challenge her authority. Only this attribute of sovereignty has made her a member", "in the comity of nations. Without sovereignty she has no essence. If a state cannot\nfreely determine what it wants and how to achieve it, it loses the rationale to exist.\nFurther, sovereignty gives the state the dignity of existence. It would not receive", "respect from within as well from outside if it does not possess the sovereign status.\nThis suggests that sovereignty is one of the most important values of a state.\nSelf - Learning\n18 Material\nTherefore, the government is duty bound to defend its sovereignty by preventing The Indian Constitution", "any kind of threat to it coming from any entity and direction.\nThough our Constitution does not specify where the sovereign authority lies\nbut by mentioning the source of our Constitution as \u2018We the people of India\u2019 it\nNOTES", "NOTES\nannounces to the world that the ultimate sovereignty rests with the people of India\nas a whole. Political sovereignty is the hinge of our polity. Accordingly, it is implied\nthat the constitutional authorities and organs of government derive their power", "only from the people. Therefore, our political system should ensure the support\nand approval of people to it. Article-51A(c), on the other hand, says that it shall\nbe the duty of every citizen to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity\nof India.\n(ii) Socialism", "of India.\n(ii) Socialism\nThe word \u2018socialist\u2019 was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act of\n1976, however, several articles of our Constitution were already there giving\ncredence to the ideal. The fathers of our Constitution had a wider vision of social", "transformation. Despite all social, economic and political inequality present and\ninherent in Indian traditional society, our Constitution started a crusade against\nthat order. The Constitution has deliberately imposed on us the ideal of socialist", "pattern of society\u2014a kind of Indian model of socialism to suit to our needs and\ntemperament. It stands to end all forms of exploitation in all spheres of our existence.\nOur Constitution directs the state to ensure a planned and coordinated social", "advance in all fields while preventing concentration of wealth and power in few\nhands. Our Constitution supports land reforms, promotes the well-being of working\nclass and advocates for social control of all important natural resources and means", "of production for the well-being of all sections. To ensure a basic minimum to all\nhas been the crux of many of our public policies today. Government of India has\nadopted mixed economy, introduced five year plans and has framed many such", "laws to achieve the value of socialism in a democratic set up. To achieve the\nobjective of socialism, Part-IV of our Constitution has outlined the principles to\nbe followed.\n(iii) Secularism\nIndia is a home to almost all major religions in the world. To keep the followers of", "all these religions together, secularism has been found to be a convenient formula.\nThe ideal of secularism in Indian context implies that our country is not guided by\nany religion or any religious considerations. However, our polity is not against", "religions. It allows all its citizens to profess, preach and practice any religion of\ntheir liking. Articles from 25 to 28 ensure freedom of religion to all its citizens.\nConstitution strictly prohibits any discrimination on the ground of religion. All", "minority communities are granted the right to conserve their distinctive culture and\nthe right to administer their educational institutions. The Supreme Court in S.R\nBommai vs Union of India held that secularism was an integral part of the basic", "structure of the Constitution.

Despite the Constitutional provisions and safeguards it is unfortunate\nSelf - Learning\nMaterial 19", "Self - Learning\nMaterial 19\nThe Indian Constitution that we still remain insufficiently secular. That has resulted in communal riots.\nTherefore, to achieve true secularism has remained a challenging objective.\n(iv) Democracy", "(iv) Democracy\nNOTES India is a democracy. We have adopted parliamentary democracy to ensure a\nresponsible and stable government. As a form of government it derives its authority\nfrom the will of the people. The people elect the rulers of the country and the latter", "remain accountable to the people. The people of India elect their governments at\nall levels (Union, State and local) by a system of universal adult franchise; popularly\nknown as \u2018One man one vote\u2019. Elections are held periodically to ensure the approval", "of the people to the governments at different levels. All the citizens without any\ndiscrimination on the basis of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion or education are\nallowed freedom of speech, thought and expression and also association.", "Democracy contributes to stability in the society and it secures peaceful change of\nrulers. It allows dissent and encourages tolerance. It rules by persuasion, not by\ncoercion. It stands for a constitutional government, rule of law, inalienable rights of", "citizens, independence of judiciary, free and fair elections and freedom of press\netc. Therefore, to develop a democratic political culture has been an important\nobjective.\n(v) Republic\nAs opposed to a monarchy, our Constitution prefers to remain a republic. The", "office of the head of the state is elective. This idea strengthens and substantiates\ndemocracy that every citizen of India (barring some who are constitutionally\ndisqualified) after attaining a particular age is equally eligible to become the head", "of the state if he is elected as such. Political equality is its chief message. Any sort\nof hereditary rule is thus regarded as a disvalue in India.\n1.5 BASIC FEATURES OF THE INDIAN\nCONSTITUTION\nThe Indian Constitution represents the vision and values of its founding fathers and", "is the basis of the faith and aspiration of Indian people. When the Indian Constitution\nwas formally ratified on 26 November 1949, it concluded a process that resulted\nin a remarkably forward-looking document that enshrined individual liberty, equality", "of opportunity, social justice and secularism. As per this Constitution, the Republic\nof India was inaugurated on 26 January 1950.\nSalient Features of the Indian Constitution\nSalient features of the Constitution of the Republic of India are as follows:\n1. Living Document", "1. Living Document\nThe Constitution is a living document, an instrument which makes the governmental\nsystem work. Unlike many other developing countries that became Independent\nafter the World War II, it has survived as a living document with necessary\namendments.\nSelf - Learning\n20 Material", "amendments.\nSelf - Learning\n20 Material\n2. Written Constitution The Indian Constitution\nThe Constitution of the Republic of India is written. As originally passed, it had\n395 Articles and 8 Schedules. The written Constitution is very essential for a", "federal state so that whenever there is any dispute between the federal government\nNOTES\nand the federating units, it becomes the basis to resolve these disputes. In sheer\nphysical terms, Indian Constitution is definitely the largest and most detailed", "Constitution in the world. The Constitution of USA contains only 7 Articles,\nCanada\u2019s 147 Articles and Australia\u2019s 128 Articles.\nThe framers of the Constitution tried to provide the solution of all the possible\nproblems of administration and governance of the country. Even those matters", "which are taken as conventions in other countries have been put to writing in the\nIndian Constitution.\n3. Sovereign Democratic Republic\nThe Indian Independence Act, 1947 declared India a dominion with the Queen of\nEngland as the Head of the State. The Governor-General was appointed by the", "Queen and acted as her representative in India. The authors of the Constitution\ndecided that Dominion status was not in conformity with the dignity of the Indian\nnation. The preamble of the Constitution, therefore, declared India as a Sovereign", "Democratic Republic. It means that India as a nation does not owe allegiance to\nany foreign power, is independent in her dealings with foreign countries and enjoys\nequal status in the world community with other independent sovereign states.", "India is a democracy. It means that sovereignty rests with the people of\nIndia. They govern themselves through their representatives elected on the basis\nof universal adult franchise. Besides, the Constitution confers on Indian citizens", "some fundamental rights which are considered to be the essence of a democratic\nsystem.\n4. Parliamentary Form of Government\nThe Constitution provides for a Parliamentary form of government which is federal\nin structure with certain unitary features. The constitutional head of the Executive", "of the Union is the President. As per Article 79 of the Constitution of India, the\ncouncil of the Parliament of the Union consists of the President and two Houses\nknown as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok", "Sabha). Article 74(1) of the Constitution provides that there shall be a Council of\nMinisters with the Prime Minister as its head to aid and advise the President, who\nshall exercise his functions in accordance with the Prime Minister\u2019s advice. The", "real executive power is thus vested in the Council of Ministers with the Prime\nMinister as its head.\nThe Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the House of the\nPeople (Lok Sabha). Every State has a Legislative Assembly. Certain States have", "an upper House also called State Legislative Council. There is a Governor for\neach State who is appointed by the President. Governor is the head of the State\nand the executive power of the State is vested in him. The Council of Ministers", "with the Chief Minister as its head advises the Governor in the discharge of executive\nSelf - Learning\nMaterial 21\nThe Indian Constitution functions. The Council of Ministers of a State is collectively responsible to the\nLegislative Assembly of the State.", "Legislative Assembly of the State.\nThe Constitution distributes legislative powers between Parliament and State\nlegislatures as per the lists of entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.\nNOTES\nThe residuary powers are vested in the Parliament. The centrally administered", "territories are called Union Territories.\n5. A Federal System with Unitary Bias\nThe Constitution is federal in nature but the term \u2018Federation\u2019 has not been used in\nour Constitution. India has been described as a Union of States according to", "Article 1 of the Constitution. There are twenty-eight states in the union, each one\nwith a separate Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. Powers have been divided\nbetween the Union Government on the one hand and the States on the other by", "the Constitution itself. The Constitution is sovereign and there is provision for\njudicial review.\nThe most remarkable feature of the Indian Constitution is to confer upon a\nfederal system the strength of a unitary government. Though normally the system", "of government is federal, during an emergency the Constitution enables the\nfederation to transform into a unitary State.\n6. Adult Franchise\nAt the time when the Constitution was made, the vast majority of Indian people", "were illiterate. The framers of the Constitution took the bold step of conferring the\nright to vote on every adult citizen of India irrespective of the differences of\neducation, property or sex. Every citizen who was 21 years of age was given the", "right to vote. It has been reduced to 18 years now. This makes the Constitution\ndemocratic in the real sense of the term.\n7. Rigid and Flexible\nThe Constitution is rigid in the sense that most of its parts cannot be amended by\nthe ordinary law-making process. However, it provided for amendments and", "therefore it is flexible. The Indian Constituent Assembly has not only refrained\nfrom putting a seal of finality and infallibility upon this Constitution as in Canada or\nby making the amendment of the Constitution subject to the fulfilment of", "extraordinary terms and conditions as in America or Australia. In its place, it has\nprovided a most facile procedure for amending the Constitution.\nIt is only the amendment of few of the provisions of the Constitution that", "requires ratification by the State legislatures and even then ratification by only half\nof them is sufficient.\nThe rest of the Constitution can be amended by the special majority of the\nunion Parliament, i.e., a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of", "each House present and voting, which again must be a majority of the total\nmembership of the House.\nWithin a period of less than 60 years, the Constitution has been amended\n94 times. It proves that the Constitution is flexible. The procedure laid down by\nSelf - Learning\n22 Material", "Self - Learning\n22 Material\nthe Constitution for its amendment is neither very easy, as in England, nor very The Indian Constitution\nrigid as in the United States.\n8. Independence of Judiciary\nThe framers of the Constitution were aware that democratic freedoms were NOTES", "meaningless in the absence of an independent machinery to safeguard them. No\nsubordinate or agent of the government could be trusted to be just and impartial in\njudging the merits of a conflict in which the Government itself was a party. Similarly,", "a judiciary subordinates either to the Centre or the States could not be trusted as an\nimpartial arbiter of conflicts and controversies between the Centre and the States.\nThese were the compelling reasons for the creation of an independent judiciary", "as an integral part of the Constitution and for the adoption of judicial independence\nas a basic principle of the Constitution.\n9. Supreme Court and Judicial Review\nSupreme Court is a necessary element in a federal polity. Accordingly, the Indian", "Constitution has established a Supreme Court of India. The Court has both original\nand appellate jurisdiction. It has the power of judicial review. It can declare any\nLegislative enactment or administrative act as unconstitutional if it is deemed to be", "in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. Besides, the Supreme Court is a\ncourt of record.\n10. Single Citizenship\nThe Constitution of India grants only one citizenship to all the citizens. In a federation\nsometimes a citizen gets double citizenship, one of the Union and the other of", "State in which that person lives.\n11. Detailed Administrative Provisions\nAs Dr B.R. Ambedkar observed, it is perfectly possible to pervert the Constitution\nwithout changing the form of administration. To prevent such subversion of the", "Constitution, detailed administrative provisions were included in it.\nWe have in the Indian Constitution detailed provisions about the organization\nof the judiciary, the services, the Public Service Commission, Election and about\nthe division of powers between the Union and the States.", "12. Constitution of the Units\nThe Constitution of a federal State usually deals only with the federal Government\nand leaves the federating units to draw their own constitutions. This practice was\nfollowed in the framing of the constitutions of the USA, USSR, Canada and other", "Federal States. However, the Indian Constitution provides the Constitutions of\nboth the Union and the States. This has contributed to the bulk of the Indian\nConstitution.\n13. Secular State\nIndia is a secular State. It means that the State does not recognize, establish or", "endow any church or religious organization. It is not guided in the discharge of its\nfunctions by the considerations of secular or the worldly welfare of the people. It Self - Learning\nMaterial 23", "Material 23\nThe Indian Constitution does not seek to promote the spiritual or religious welfare of the people. It allows\nfreedom of religion. The Constitution guarantees freedom of worship, faith and\nconscience. It does not discriminate in matters of government employment on the", "basis of religion. The term \u2018Secular\u2019 did not occur in any part of the original\nNOTES\nConstitution. It was incorporated in the preamble by the Forty-second Constitutional\nAmendment in 1976.\n14. Welfare State\nThe preamble of the constitution describes India as a socialist state. The term was", "added to the preamble of the Constitution by the Forty-second Constitutional\nAmendment Act of 1976 by the Indira Gandhi led Congress government. However,\nit is to be noted that \u2018Socialism\u2019 envisaged by the Constitution is not the usual", "State socialism seen in Russia or China which entailed the nationalization of all the\nmeans of production, distribution, communication, etc. Indira Gandhi explained\nthe nature of Indian Socialism by stating, \u2018We have always said that we have our", "own brand of socialism. We will nationalize the sectors where we feel the necessity.\nJust nationalization is not our type of socialism.\u2019 Socialism in the Indian context\nmeans that the government endeavours to make the distribution of wealth more", "equal, provides a decent standard of living for all and is committed towards the\nformation of a welfare state.\n15. Liberal Constitution\nLiberalism is a political philosophy that is centred on the freedom of an individual.", "The Indian Constitution contains many features that make it liberal in nature, the\nmost important being the section on fundamental rights.\nThe constitution of India recognizes six fundamental rights. These are:\n1. Right to equality, including equality before law, prohibition of discrimination", "on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, and equality of\nopportunity in matters of employment, abolition of untouchability and\nabolition of titles.\n2. Right to freedom which includes speech and expression, assembly,", "association or union or cooperatives, movement, residence, and right to\npractice any profession or occupation, right to life and liberty, right to\neducation, protection in respect to conviction in offences and protection\nagainst arrest and detention in certain cases.", "against arrest and detention in certain cases.\n3. Right against exploitation, prohibiting all forms of forced labour, child labour\nand traffic in human beings.\n4. Right to freedom of religion, including freedom of conscience and free", "profession, practice, and propagation of religion, freedom to manage religious\naffairs, freedom from certain taxes and freedom from religious instructions\nin certain educational institutes.\n5. Cultural and Educational rights preserving Right of any section of citizens to", "conserve their culture, language or script, and right of minorities to establish\nand administer educational institutions of their choice.\n6. Right to constitutional remedies for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.\nSelf - Learning\n24 Material", "Self - Learning\n24 Material\nThese six fundamental rights guaranteed in the Indian constitution is The Indian Constitution\ncomparable to features seen in liberal constitutions around the world including the\nBill of Rights in the American Constitution. Along with the fundamental rights, the", "remedies for enforcing the rights, namely, the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus,\nNOTES\nprohibition and certiorari are also guaranteed by the Constitution under Article\n32. However, unlike other liberal constitutions around the world, the Indian", "Constitution today does not recognize the right to property as a fundamental right.\nAlthough originally a part of the Indian Constitution, the right to property was\ndeleted from the list of fundamental rights after the 44th Amendment to the", "Constitution in 1978. However at the same time, in another part of the Constitution,\nArticle 300 (A) was inserted to affirm that no person shall be deprived of his or\nher property save by authority of law. Thus, today the right to property in India is\na legal and not a fundamental right.", "a legal and not a fundamental right.\n16. Fundamental Duties\nPart IVA on fundamental duties was incorporated in the Constitution by the Forty-\nsecond Amendment Act. Article 51A of the Constitution enumerates ten fundamental", "duties of the citizens of India: to respect and abide by the Constitution and the\nlaws; to uphold the sovereignty of the nation; to respect the democratic institutions\nenshrined in the Constitution; to abjure communalism and violence, etc. However,", "unlike the fundamental rights, the fundamental duties are not enforceable in the\ncourts.\n17. Directive Principles of State Policy\nA distinctive feature of the Constitution is that it contains Chapter IV on the Directive", "Principles of State Policy. These Directives relate mostly to social and economic\njustice, such as adequate means of livelihood for all, distribution of wealth so as to\nserve the common good, equal pay for equal work, protection of adult and child", "labour, free and compulsory primary education, etc. These are the guiding principles\nof State policy. The authors of the Constitution did not make the Directive Principles\njusticiable.\nThe Directive Principles are not enforceable by the courts, i.e., if the", "government of the day fails to carry out these objects no court can make the\ngovernment ensure them. Still the principles have been declared to be fundamental\nin the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these\nprinciples in making laws.", "principles in making laws.\n18. Drawn from Different Sources\nA distinguishing feature of the Indian Constitution is that it was prepared after\ncarefully looking at all the known constitutions of the world at that time. The first", "meeting of the Constituent Assembly of India took place in the Constitution Hall,\nNew Delhi. On 9 December 1946, it was chaired by Dr Sachchidananda Sinha.\nIn his address Dr Sinha referred to several constitutions that were in existence at\nthat time and said:", "that time and said:\nAs a matter of fact, the French constitution-makers, who met in 1789\nat the first Constituent Assembly of their country, were themselves\nlargely influenced by the work done but a couple of years earlier in Self - Learning\nMaterial 25", "Material 25\nThe Indian Constitution 1787, by the historic Constitutional Convention held at Philadelphia\nby the American constitution-makers, for their country.

It is\nNOTES\nthis great constitution, which had been naturally taken as the model\nfor all subsequent constitutions not only of France, but also of the", "self-governing Dominions of the British Commonwealth, like Canada,\nAustralia, and South Africa; and I have no doubt that you will also, in\nthe nature of things, pay in the course of your work, greater attention\nto the provisions of the American Constitution than to those of any\nother.", "other.\nThe parliamentary system has been borrowed from England, the concept\nof independent judiciary and judicial review and fundamental rights from the US\nConstitution, the federal features from Canada and the Directive Principles from", "Ireland.

India\u2019s religious and ethnic diversity,\ncaste inequalities and widespread illiteracy and poverty demanded these unique\nprovisions. The Constituent Assembly members were equal to this task, debating", "and discussing the clauses of the Draft Constitution threadbare.\n19. Reservation in Legislatures and Services for Backward Classes\nA distinctive feature of the Indian Constitution is that there is reservation of seats\nfor the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People and in", "the State Assemblies. The Constitution also lays down that the claims of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration in making\nappointments to services in connection with the affairs of the Union or a State.", "There is also reservation of the seats for Anglo-Indian community in the\nHouse of the People and in some State Assemblies.\n20. Official Language of India\nA provision was made in the Constitution to declare Hindi in the Devanagiri script", "as the official language of India. Till that time English was to continue as the official\nlanguage.\n21. Basic Structure\nArticle 368 of the Constitution gives the impression that Parliament\u2019s amending\npowers are absolute and encompass all parts of the document. However, the", "Supreme Court has acted as an arbiter to the legislative enthusiasm of Parliament\never since Independence.

However, the final word on the issue of the basic structure of the\nConstitution has not been pronounced by the Supreme Court yet.

But the", "Right to Property was repealed in 1978 by the Forty-Fourth Constitutional\nAmendment bill during the rule of the Janata Government. These fundamental\nrights constitute the soul of the Constitution and thereby provide it a dimension of", "permanence. These rights enjoy an esteemed position as all legislations have to\nconform to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. Not only this, its remarkable\nfeature is that these rights encompass all those rights which human ingenuity has", "found to be essential for the development and growth of human beings.\nThe Constitution classifies fundamental rights into six categories:\n\uf0b7 Right to equality (Articles 14\u201318)\n\uf0b7 Right to freedom (Articles 19\u201322)\n\uf0b7 Right against exploitation (Articles 23\u201324)", "\uf0b7 Right against exploitation (Articles 23\u201324)\n\uf0b7 Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25\u201328)\n\uf0b7 Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29\u201330)\n\uf0b7 Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32)\nRight to Equality (Article 14\u201318)", "Right to Equality (Article 14\u201318)\nArticle 14 declares that the State shall not deny any person the equality before the\nlaw or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India. As interpreted by\nthe courts, it means that though the state shall not deny to any person equality", "before law or the equal protection of law, it shall have the right to classify citizens,\nprovided that such a classification is rational and is related to the object sought to\nbe achieved by the law.\nSelf - Learning\n34 Material\n(i) Equality before law Fundamental Rights,\nDuties and the Union", "Duties and the Union\nEquality before law does not mean an absolute equality of men which is a physical Executive\nimpossibility.

It also states that individuals are equally\nNOTES", "NOTES\nsubjected to the ordinary laws of the land.\n(ii) Equal protection of laws\nThis clause has been taken verbatim from the XIV amendment to American\nconstitution. Equal protection means the right to equal treatment in similar", "circumstances both with regard to the legal privileges and liabilities. In other words,\nthere should be no discrimination between one person and another, if their position\nis the same with regard to the subject matter of legislation. The principle of equal", "protection does not mean that every law must have a universal application for all\npersons, who are not by nature, circumstance or attainments (knowledge, virtue\nor money) in the same position as others. Varying needs of different classes or", "persons require separate treatment and a law enacted with this object in view is\nnot considered to be violative of equal protection. The Constitution, however,\ndoes not stand for absolute equality. The State may classify persons for the purpose", "of legislation. But this classification should be on reasonable grounds. Equal\nprotection has reference to the persons who have same nature, attainments,\nqualifications or circumstances. It means that the State is debarred from", "discriminating between or amongst the same class of persons in so far as special\nprotection, privileges or liabilities are concerned. Thus, equal protection does not\nrequire that every law must be all-embracing, all-inclusive and universally applicable.", "(iii) Prohibition of discrimination (Article 15)\nArticle 15(1) prohibits discrimination on certain grounds. It declares, \u2018The state\nshall not discriminate against any citizen on ground only of religion, race, caste,", "sex, place of birth or any of them.\u2019 This discrimination is prohibited with regard to\n\u2018(a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment;\nor (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort", "maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general\npublic\u2019. Article 15 has, however, to notable exceptions in its application. The first\nof these permits the State to make special provision for the benefit of women and", "children. The second allows the State to make any special provision for the\nadvancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or for\nscheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The special treatment meted out to women", "and children is in the larger and long-term interest of the community itself. The\nsecond exception was not in the original Constitution, but was later on added to it\nas a result of the First Amendment of the Constitution in 1951. While freedom", "contained in Article 14 is available to all persons, that in Article15 is available only\nto the citizens and, therefore, it cannot be invoked by non-citizens.\nArticle 15(2) proclaims that no citizen shall, on grounds only of religion,", "race, casts, sex and place of birth be subject to any disability, liability, restriction\nor condition with regard to:\nSelf - Learning\nMaterial 35\nFundamental Rights, \uf0b7 Access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public\nDuties and the Union\nentertainment\nExecutive", "Duties and the Union\nentertainment\nExecutive\n\uf0b7 The use of wells, tanks, bathing-ghats, roads and places of public resort,\nmaintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of\nNOTES\nthe general public\nThe prohibition in this clause is levelled not only against the State but also", "against private persons.\nArticle 15(3) provides that the State shall be free to make any special\nprovision for women and children. This sub-article is in the nature of an exception\nin favour of women and children. Thus, the provision of free education for children", "up to a certain age or the provision of special maternity leave for women workers\nis not discrimination. However, discrimination in favour of women in respect of\npolitical rights is not justified, as women are not regarded as a backward class in", "comparison to men for special political representation.\nArticle 15(4) allows the State to make special provision for the advancement\nof any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the\nscheduled castes and the scheduled tribes. The State is, therefore, free to reserve", "seats for them in the legislature and the services. This Article only allows the State\nto make special provisions for these classes. Inserted under Ninety-Third\nConstitutional Amendment Act, this clause conferred on the State the power to", "make any special provision by law for the advancement of any socially and\neducationally backward class or for the scheduled castes or the scheduled tribes\nin so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational", "institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by\nthe State, other than the minority educational institutions.\n(iv) Equality of opportunity (Article 16)\nArticle 16(1) reads: \u2018There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters", "relating to employment to any office under the State.\u2019 It confers on every citizen, a\nright to equality of economic opportunity, and subsequently provides that no citizen\nshall be discriminated against in this respect on grounds only of religion, race,", "caste, descent, place of birth or any of them. However, an equality of opportunity\nis only between equals, i.e. between persons who are either seeking the same\nemployment or have obtained the same employment. In other words, equality", "means equality between members of the same class or employees, and not between\nmembers of different classes.\nArticle 16 (2) reads: \u2018No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race,\ncaste, sex, descent, place or birth, residence or any one of them be ineligible for", "or discriminated against in respect of any employment or office under the State.\u2019\nArticle 16 (3) says that the President is competent to allow states to make\nresidency as a necessary qualification in certain services for ensuring efficiently of\nwork.", "work.\nArticle 16 (4) allows the State to reserve appointments in favour of a\nbackward class of citizens which in its opinion is not adequately represented in the\nSelf - Learning\n36 Material\nservices under the State.

This is an\nexception to the general rule that the State shall not discriminate on ground of\nreligion in providing equal economic opportunities to the citizens.", "Although Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public\nemployment, for all citizens and is expected to provide a bulwark against\nconsiderations of caste, community and religion, the result so far has been far from\nsatisfactory.", "satisfactory.\n(v) Social equality by abolition of untouchability (Article 17)\nComplete abolition of untouchability was one of the items in Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s\nprogramme for social reform. The present Article adopts the Gandhian ideal without", "any qualification in abolishing untouchability and in forbidding its practice. It also\ndeclares that the enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability shall be\nan offence punishable in accordance with law.\nThe practice of untouchability is a denial of human equality in an acute form.", "In pursuance of Article 17, the Parliament has enacted the Untouchability Offences\nAct, 1955, which was later amended in 1976.
